create a webpage that imports a stock price from an external API and displays it in a table format. The webpage should include a header, a footer, and a navigation bar. The stock price should be updated every 5 seconds using JavaScript. The webpage should be styled using CSS to make it visually appealing. The API used to fetch the stock price should be a public API that does not require authentication.
